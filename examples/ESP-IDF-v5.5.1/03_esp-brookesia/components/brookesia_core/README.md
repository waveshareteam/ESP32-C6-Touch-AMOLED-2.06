* [中文版本](./README_CN.md)

## Overview

> [!WARNING]
> Brookesia-Core is currently in experimental development phase, and various functional interfaces may be subject to changes.

Brookesia-Core is the core component of ESP-Brookesia, providing fundamental system functionality with the following key features:

- Provides rich standardized system UI with support for dynamic UI style adjustments.
- Adopts an app-based application management approach, enabling UI isolation and coexistence of multiple apps, allowing users to focus on UI implementation within their respective apps.
- Application UI is compatible with "[Squareline](https://squareline.io/) export code" development approach.

The functional demonstration of various system UIs is shown below:
